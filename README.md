Weather Dashboard 

Description

The Weather Dashboard application was created by fetching Server-side API weather data that allow developers to make requests with parameters, data and functionality, 
to a URL. The fetched current weather data and 5-day forecast weather persistent data for cities are stored in the local storage, and the application feature dynamically
displays and updates the data on the weather dashboard. Web developers often encounter tasks with retrieving data from various application's APIs with API keys, the data
collected is used in the context of their own.
